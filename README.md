# Movie Hub

This project was created to showcase a simple ReactJs based website that uses a public movie API provided by TMDB - https://www.themoviedb.org/
It is a web page that fetches data from the TMDB API through axios and displays it through componenets built with the help of MaterialUI component library - https://mui.com/.
